## Getting Telegram Bot token
On Telegram, create a new Telegram bot by talking to [@botfather](https://telegram.me/botfather) and thereafter getting the token for the Telegram Bot.

## Deploy to Netlify

Deploy to Netlify either by linking to this repository manually or by clicking the "Deploy to netlify" above.

Remember to fill in the environment variables on netlify - ```TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN``` with the token and the secret key obtained respectively

## Hooking up the Bot

Therafter, you need to specify and tell telegram where your bot should direct the messages it received to. Do so by simply visiting this url (without the ```{```, ```}```)

```
https://api.telegram.org/bot{your_bot_token}/setWebhook?url={your_netlify_domain_url}/api/bot
```

If it is setup correctly it should reponse back with

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "result": true,
  "description": "Webhook was set"
}
```

Afterwhich, YOU ARE DONE!ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

Try typing ```/order``` to your bot and watch as the user ID of the Telegram user is stored inside your FaunaDB database
